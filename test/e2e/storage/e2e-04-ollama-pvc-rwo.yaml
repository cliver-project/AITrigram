# E2E Test: ModelRepository with PVC ReadWriteOnce (RWO) storage for Ollama
# Works with most storage classes including local-path, standard, gp2, etc.
# The model download and LLMEngine pods will be pinned to the same node
#
# Note: The PVC will be automatically created by the controller in the
# aitrigram-system namespace (where the controller runs)
# The download job will bind to a node, and status.boundNodeName will be set
